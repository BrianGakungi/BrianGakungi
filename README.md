I'm an accountant and data scientist looking to hack the financial analysis world. I got intrigued by data at first when working around high school statistics and was convinced that I had to join the data science community while pursuing quantitative analysis in my CPA. The fact that understanding patterns in data enables you to prepare for the future outcomes is just fascinating.
